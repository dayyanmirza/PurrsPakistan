      <p>
      Welcome to Purrs of Pakistan, a dedicated platform for the rescue and care of cats in need. 
      Our mission is to provide life-saving treatments, rescue operations, and find loving homes for every cat. 
      Founded by passionate animal lovers, Purrs of Pakistan has grown into a community of volunteers, donors, and adopters who share our vision of a world where every cat is safe, loved, and well-cared for. 
      We operate foster homes, a medical facility, and an adoption program to match cats with their forever families. Your support through donations, volunteering, or spreading the word makes a real difference. 
      Thank you for being part of our mission.
